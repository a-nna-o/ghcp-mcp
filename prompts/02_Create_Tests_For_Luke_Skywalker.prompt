Tests are missing for the Luke Skywalker API call

# content
It seems that we are missing tests for the Luke Skywalker API call. Please create a test class that tests the following:
- The API call is successful
- The API call returns the correct DTO
- The API call returns the correct properties in the DTO
- The API call returns the correct status code

Reassure your asserts by taking the real payload under https://swapi.info/api/people/1.json and crosschecking that all your asserts are correct and all properties are handled.
